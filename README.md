# Autonomous-navigation-of-a-Turtlebot-3-through-an-obstacle-course
Updates and contributions of Autonomous navigation of a Turtlebot 3 through an obstacle course project as a part of the Autonomy Science and Systems course

## My Contribution:
1. Implemented a robust control strategy to provide yaw and longitudinal speed commands to the turtle bot using LiDAR point cloud data of the obstacle, based on the distance to collision.
2. Utilized the Gazebo virtual environment to test the control inputs to the turtlebot and then implemented it in real life with dynamic obstacles.
